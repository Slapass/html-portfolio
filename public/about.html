<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>I am currently a 1st Lieutenant serving as an Aircraft Maintenance officer in the United States Air Force. I was born in Irving, TX and am the middle child of three - I have a brother, two years my elder, and a younger sister who is two years younger. 
  I lived the first 5 years of my life in Guadalajara Mexico where I grew up speaking Spanish, and then moved to Houston Texas with the rest of my family, where I received my primary, secondary and highschool education. During this time,
  I was heavily involved in competitive soccer, traveling and competing in tournaments all around the US. After graduating Highschool, I moved to San Antonio for college. Following graduation and commissioning,
  I got orders to Okinawa, Japan where I was stationed from Nov 2019 to Nov 2021. I am currently stationed at Travis AFB, CA and am the Officer In Charge for a 400-person unit responsible for 
  the maintenance and generation of 24 KC-10 aircraft. I'm looking to make a career change, and am interested in the development world.
  I am currently engaged to my beautiful fiance, Lauren, who is currently pursuing a Post-Bac program in efforts to apply to medical school a year from now.
